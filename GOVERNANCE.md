# OpenPrint3D Governance

OpenPrint3D is an open, community-driven standard for portable and interoperable 3D-printing profiles.  
This governance document defines how decisions are made, how maintainers operate, and how the project remains neutral, predictable, and sustainable as it grows.

The goal is **clarity without complexity**.  
This project succeeds by being open, trustworthy, and technically rigorous — not by weighing contributors down with process.

---

## 1. Purpose

OpenPrint3D governance exists to:

- Maintain the project’s **vendor-neutral** stance  
- Ensure long-term sustainability through shared stewardship  
- Provide clarity around roles, responsibilities, and decision processes  
- Empower maintainers without creating central bottlenecks  
- Build confidence for users, developers, manufacturers, and slicer authors  

This framework is deliberately lightweight and may evolve as the project matures.

---

## 2. Roles

### 2.1 Founder
The Founder (currently **Michael “Synthetic Electron 3D”**) serves as:

- Vision and long-term strategy lead  
- Final arbiter on major or direction-changing decisions  
- Gatekeeper for appointing new maintainers  
- Primary public representative when needed  
- Steward of project neutrality and clarity  

The Founder does **not** handle all day-to-day operations. Maintainers share that responsibility.

---

### 2.2 Maintainers
Maintainers are trusted individuals who help operate the project. Their responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests  
- Triaging and labeling issues  
- Ensuring schema, documentation, and tooling changes align with OP3D principles  
- Participating in technical discussions and roadmap development  
- Collaborating with the Founder and other maintainers on major changes  

Maintainers act with **consensus whenever possible**.

#### Provisional Maintainers
New maintainers may be added on a provisional basis (typically 30–60 days) until consistent engagement and alignment with OP3D principles are demonstrated.

#### Emeritus Maintainers
If a maintainer becomes inactive for an extended period (e.g., 60–90 days), they may be moved to Emeritus status until returning.

---

### 2.3 Contributors
Anyone may contribute to OpenPrint3D through:

- Pull requests  
- Issue reporting  
- Proposals  
- Documentation improvements  
- Schema/design discussions  

Contributors do not have merging privileges but are essential to project growth.

---

### 2.4 Advisors (Optional / Future)
Subject-matter experts — including manufacturers or slicer developers — may be invited to provide input on:

- Material science considerations  
- Firmware/slicer integration  
- Vendor implementation feasibility  

Advisors do not have merge rights unless separately appointed as maintainers.

---

## 3. Decision-Making

OpenPrint3D uses a pragmatic model that balances speed with community input.

### 3.1 Types of Decisions

#### A. Routine Changes
Examples:
- Documentation cleanups  
- Typo fixes  
- Minor schema clarifications  

Handled directly by maintainers.

---

#### B. Significant Technical Changes
Examples:
- Major schema additions  
- Breaking schema changes  
- New data models  
- Changes affecting interoperability or profile structure  

Require:
- Maintainer consensus  
- Founder confirmation  
- Discussion in a GitHub Issue prior to merge  

---

#### C. Strategic or Governance-Level Changes
Examples:
- Modifications to governance  
- Licensing changes  
- Direction-changing shifts to the standard  
- API or ecosystem-breaking changes  

Require:
- Founder approval  
- Maintainer input  
- A community discussion window (typically 5–14 days)

---

## 4. Guiding Principles

All decisions should align with the following principles:

### Neutrality
No vendor bias. The standard must remain open, fair, and universally adoptable.

### Clarity & Minimalism
Prefer the simplest structure that solves the problem.

### Stability
Avoid breaking changes unless absolutely necessary.

### Interoperability
Schemas and profiles must facilitate compatibility across slicers, printers, and vendors.

### Reproducibility
Implementations must not rely on proprietary or inaccessible tooling.

---

## 5. Maintainer Expectations

Maintainers are expected to:

- Review pull requests within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 7 days)  
- Engage in discussions when tagged  
- Uphold project principles and neutrality  
- Disclose conflicts of interest  
- Coordinate with other maintainers on significant changes  
- Step back when unavailable for extended periods  

Maintainers represent the project and are expected to model professionalism, clarity, and respect.

---

## 6. Conflict Resolution

Most disagreements should be resolved through:

1. Technical reasoning  
2. Reference to project principles  
3. Maintainer consensus  

If consensus cannot be reached, the Founder serves as the final decision-maker to ensure the project continues moving forward.

---

## 7. Transparency

OpenPrint3D operates publicly and transparently:

- Major proposals should be discussed in GitHub Issues  
- Significant changes require clearly communicated rationale  
- Roadmap updates and governance adjustments should be shared openly  

Private communication may be used for early vendor discussions or sensitive topics but is not the norm.

---

## 8. Long-Term Sustainability

OpenPrint3D is intended to outlive any single individual.  
If the Founder permanently steps back:

- Maintainers may elect a **Lead Maintainer** by majority vote  
- The project remains open-source, vendor-neutral, and community-driven  

This ensures continuity and trust for adopters.

---

## 9. Vendor Participation

Manufacturers, slicer developers, and other industry participants are welcome, but:

- No vendor receives preferential influence  
- No proprietary lock-in is permitted  
- Any extensions must remain open and freely implementable  

The standard must benefit the entire ecosystem, not any single entity.

---

## 10. Amendments

This governance document may be amended through:

- A proposal via GitHub Issue  
- Maintainer discussion  
- Founder approval  
- A public comment period when appropriate  

Amendments should maintain the spirit of openness, neutrality, and simplicity.
